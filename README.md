### Project 3: PicTalk

# Project Requirements:
In this project we have combine a scalable MongoDB back end, a REST API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. We have build on the agile development methodologies we’ve used throughout this course. These include storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

For this project, we have started from scratch. We are allow to revisit our front-end abilities in the context of React and solidify  understanding of working with multiple servers in a MERN application. We have builded skills have continued to improve since the first two projects, so naturally our approach are different considering the experience we’ve gained with each new application we’ve built.

The group  use everything we’ve learned throughout this course to create a MERN-stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data. This project helped us to provide  with the best opportunity to demonstrate our problem-solving skills. Once again, The project fulfill the following requirements:

We Used React for the front end.

we Use REST API with a Node.js and Express.js server.

we Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

we Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

we Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

We used GitHub project to manage and share tasks for each members of the group

# Presentation Requirements:
Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for future development.
